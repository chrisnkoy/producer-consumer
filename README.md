## Introduction
The [producer-consumer problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer%E2%80%93consumer_problem) is a well known problem that multithreaded programming attempts to solve. This project's goal was to improve my grasp of concepts like ```shared resource``` and ```synchronization``` as well as methods like ```wait()``` and ```notify()```.
